# Wadl's Spicetify Stuff
A simple collection of simple Spicetify things I've made for myself.

## Custom Cover Dimensions
A CSS snippet porting the "Custom Cover Dimensions" functionality from Comfy to your favourite Spicetify theme!

### Usage
1. Navigate to the `Snippets` tab in Marketplace
2. Click the `+ Add CSS` button in the bottom right corner
3. Paste the contents of the `CustomCoverDimensions.css` into the `Custom CSS` field, and fill the others with whatever you please
4. Read the comments in the CSS and customize it to your liking!
5. Click the `Save CSS` button. Your Spotify UI should refresh, and you should see the results

## Catppuccin Mocha for Sleek
A color.ini section for the [Sleek](https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-themes/tree/master/Sleek) theme.

### Usage
1. Click on the paintbrush icon next to the colourscheme dropdown in Marketplace
2. Paste the following into the bottom of the `Color.ini editor` textbox
```
[CatppuccinMocha]
text=cdd6f4
subtext=bac2de
nav-active-text=9399b2
main=1e1e2e
sidebar=181825
player=11111b
card=313244
shadow=181825
main-secondary=313244
button=a6e3a1
button-secondary=74c7ec
button-active=a6e3a1
button-disabled=6c7086
nav-active=313244
play-button=a6e3a1
tab-active=313244
notification=313244
notification-error=f38ba8
playback-bar=a6e3a1
misc=45475A
```
3. You may want to replace any instance of a6e3a1 to the colour of your choice, I have it set to Mocha Green but you may prefer a different colour from the palette as your accent colour
4. Finally, click the Save button, and select the CatppuccinMocha option from the dropdown next to the paintbrush (you may have to restart Spotify for it to show up!)
